# Student Resources

## Overview

This repository contains the **Data Dunkers Student Portal**, a collection of Jupyter Notebook activities designed to help students build data literacy through basketball and real-world datasets.

All activities are meant to be run as Jupyter Notebooks. Each notebook combines explanation, code, visualizations, and space for student thinking. Students can work through activities independently or as part of a teacher-guided program.

All student-facing notebooks are located in the `activities/` folder.

## How to Use This Portal

- Open an activity notebook from the sections below.
- Run cells from top to bottom.
- Read the explanations, then experiment with the code.
- Use text cells to record observations, answers, and reflections.
- Save your work or follow your teacher’s instructions for submission.

If you are new to Jupyter Notebooks, start with the interpretation activities before moving on to data skills or applied analysis.

## Activity Organization

Activities are grouped into three categories:

1. Interpreting Visuals  
   Learn how to read charts and graphs before creating your own.

2. Data Skills  
   Learn core data operations that you will reuse across challenges.

3. Applied Analysis  
   Use real basketball data to explore patterns and tell data stories.

## Interpreting Visuals

These activities focus on reading and making meaning from existing graphs and charts. Minimal coding is required.

- [Interpreting Bar Graphs](activities/interpreting-bar-graphs.ipynb)
- [Interpreting Line Graphs](activities/interpreting-line-graphs.ipynb)
- [Interpreting Pie Charts](activities/interpreting-pie-charts.ipynb)
- [Interpreting Scatterplots](activities/interpreting-scatterplots.ipynb)
- [Interpreting Sunburst Plots](activities/interpreting-sunburst-plots.ipynb)

## Data Skills

These activities teach reusable data techniques using Python libraries such as pandas and NumPy.

- [Mean, Median, and Mode](activities/mean-median-mode.ipynb)
- [Standard Deviation](activities/standard-deviation.ipynb)
- [Data Cleaning](activities/data-cleaning.ipynb)
- [Data Correlations](activities/data-correlations.ipynb)
- [Data Sorting and Merging](activities/data-sorting-and-merging.ipynb)
- [Synthetic Data](activities/synthetic-data.ipynb)

## Applied Analysis

These activities apply data skills and visualization techniques to real basketball datasets.

- [Shot Charts](activities/shot-charts.ipynb)

## Notes for Students

- Mistakes are expected. Re-run cells and try again.
- Focus on what the data is showing, not just on making the code work.
- Be ready to explain what you notice and what you wonder.

## Notes for Teachers

- Activities can be used independently or combined into longer challenges.
- Students may complete activities in different orders depending on goals.
- Notebooks can be assessed through charts, written interpretations, or short reflections.
