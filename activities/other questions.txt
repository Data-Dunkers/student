1. Scoring Efficiency vs. Volume

"In the 'Efficiency Deep Dive', you analyzed Field Goal Percentage (FG%). Now, create a scatter plot with Field Goal Attempts (FGA) on the x-axis and Points (PTS) on the y-axis.

Question: Which players generate the most points for the fewest number of shots (appearing above the general trend)? Does Siakam rely more on high volume (taking many shots) or high efficiency to get his points comparing to his teammates?"

2. Defensive Versatility (Stocks)

"We often focus on offense, but 'Stocks' (Steals + Blocks) is a common metric for defensive activity.

Question: Create a new column in your dataframe that adds STL and BLK together. When you sort the team by this new 'Stocks' metric, does Siakam rank as highly on defense as he does in scoring? Who is the team's most active defender according to this data?"

3. The 3-Point Factor

"You explored Pascal Siakam’s overall shooting, but let's look at his range.

Question: Compare Siakam’s 3-Point Attempts (3PA) to his 2-Point Attempts (2PA). Is he primarily an interior scorer or a perimeter threat compared to other forwards on the Pacers? How does his 3-point efficiency (3P%) compare to the team's primary guards?"
