    "# Predicting NBA Positions Using Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "[Machine learning (ML)](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning) is the study of using data and algorithms for computers to learn. By analyzing large amounts of data, computers can identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you have a lot of information about NBA players, like how many points they score, how many rebounds they get, and how many assists they make. With machine learning, we can teach a computer to look at these stats and predict what position a player might play, like a guard, forward, or center. \n",
    "\n",
    "It's like giving the computer a bunch of clues and letting it figure out the answer! This can be helpful for coaches and teams to understand their players better and make smarter decisions during games.\n",
