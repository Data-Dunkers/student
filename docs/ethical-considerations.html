    <h2>Ethical Considerations</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">
      In a world where AI can do almost everything humans can do, but better, faster, and cheaper, what would be the point of humans? Are we moving towards that as a society?
    </p> 
    <p class="paragraph">
      Think about a referee in a basketball game. They have to make split-second decisions about fouls, out-of-bounds calls, and whether a shot was a two-pointer or a three-pointer. 
      They're human, so they make mistakes. But what if we could replace them with an AI camera system that never makes a mistake? Would that be fair? Would it make the game better?
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      Now think about a security camera at the gym door. It could track who comes in and out, and even guess how they're feeling based on their facial expression. 
      Would that be fair? Would it make the gym safer? Or would it be an invasion of privacy?
