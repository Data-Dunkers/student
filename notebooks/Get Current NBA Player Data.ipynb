{"cells":[{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# How to Use This Notebook\n","\n","1. Run **Cell 1** first.\n","   - This installs the required library (`google-colab-selenium`) for the current Colab session.\n","   - You typically only need to run this once per session (for example, after a runtime restart).\n","\n","2. Run **Cell 2** next.\n","   - This is the program that loads the ESPN stats page, clicks **Show More** until all rows are visible, extracts the tables, and saves the results as a CSV file.\n","\n","3. Find the output CSV in Colab:\n","   - On the **left-hand sidebar**, click the **Files** tab (folder icon).\n","   - If you don’t see it, expand the left sidebar until the Files tab appears.\n","   - You should see a CSV file created with a name like:\n","     `nba_player_stats_2025-2026.csv`\n","\n","4. Download the CSV to your computer:\n","   - Click the **three dots (⋮)** beside the CSV file name.\n","   - Click **Download**.\n","   - The file will download to your local machine for your own use.\n","\n","## Notes\n","- Wait until you see the printed message confirming the file was saved before downloading.\n","- If you restart the runtime, you’ll need to rerun **Cell 1** before running **Cell 2** again."],"metadata":{"id":"7BiIFJNv55W4"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":13482,"status":"ok","timestamp":1765934453514,"user":{"displayName":"Peter
